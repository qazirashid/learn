# SUDOKU SOLVER
I am just epxerimenting a little with sudoku solver.

sudoku.h contain main definitions and helper functions.
sudoku.c is an interpreter for sudoku solving language
testscript is a test script for the interpreter. 
test.sh will build the sudoku interpreter and will run a testscript thorugh it.
